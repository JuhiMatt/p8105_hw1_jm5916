This dataset describes weather conditions in early January 2023 at EWR.
The variable names in this dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour. Some important variables include time_hour, which is
stored as a date variable and describes when the data was collected,
temp, which is numeric and describes temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit,
and wind_dir and wind_speed, which describe wind direction in degrees
and wind speed in most likely mph (both numeric). There are 15 columns
and 358 rows. The mean temperature is 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Problem 1: plot

``` r
#make a scatter plot 
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jm5916_files/figure-gfm/prob_one_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("hour_v_temp_w_humidity.pdf", height = 4, width = 6) #export plot to pdf
```

This plot has a general upward trend, indicating that temperature rises
as time (in days) increases. Additionally, within each day, the
temperature varies widely going from a high during midday to a low at
night. Humidity was pretty low (\< 60) until Jan 7, after which humidity
generally increased. This was a non-linear increase as some days had
high humidity while others had low humidity.

# Problem 2

``` r
prob_two_df = tibble( #make a table
  vec_num = rnorm(10), #column with random numbers from std normal distribution 
  vec_logical = vec_num > 0, #column conditioned on if numbers in vec_num are > 0
  vec_char = c("This", "has", "ten", "characters", "well", "now", "it", "has", "that", "blah"),
    #column of 10 characters
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "low", "med", "low","med", "med", "high","med","low","low"))
    #factor column with 3 levels 
)
print(prob_two_df) #show table
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_num vec_logical vec_char   vec_factor
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>      <fct>     
    ##  1 -1.60   FALSE       This       high      
    ##  2  0.625  TRUE        has        low       
    ##  3  0.315  TRUE        ten        med       
    ##  4  0.0213 TRUE        characters low       
    ##  5 -0.0366 FALSE       well       med       
    ##  6 -0.0879 FALSE       now        med       
    ##  7  0.0326 TRUE        it         high      
    ##  8  0.300  TRUE        has        med       
    ##  9  0.479  TRUE        that       low       
    ## 10  1.00   TRUE        blah       low

I’ve made a data frame matching the specifications given

### Problem 2: means

``` r
#random sample from standard Normal distribution
pull_vec_num = pull(prob_two_df, var = vec_num) #pull variable out of dataframe
mean_vec_num = mean(pull_vec_num) #find mean of vec_num
print(mean_vec_num) #this returns a number, this variable is made up of numbers
```

    ## [1] 0.1050961

``` r
#logical vector
pull_vec_logical = pull(prob_two_df, var = vec_logical) #pull variable out of dataframe
mean_vec_logical = mean(pull_vec_logical) #find mean of vec_logical
print(mean_vec_logical) #this returns a number as true = 1 and false = 0
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
#character vector
pull_vec_char = pull(prob_two_df, var = vec_char) #pull variable out of dataframe
mean_vec_char = mean(pull_vec_char) #find mean of vec_char
print(mean_vec_char) #no number, this variable is made up of characters
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#factor vector
pull_vec_factor = pull(prob_two_df, var = vec_factor) #pull variable out of dataframe
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull_vec_factor) #find mean of vec_factor
print(mean_vec_factor) #no number, vec_factor's data has no associated numeric values
```

    ## [1] NA

### Problem 2: convert to numeric

``` r
num_vec_logical = as.numeric(pull_vec_logical) #turning vec_logical numeric works
num_vec_char = as.numeric(pull_vec_char) #turning vec_char numeric doesn't work
num_vec_factor= as.numeric(pull_vec_factor) #turning vec_factor variable numeric works
```

Both vec_logical and vec_factor are categorical (more specifically
ordered) variables that can have their data be assigned numerical
values, thus finding a mean in this case is possible because every
datapoint has an underlying numerical value. vec_char is a series of
characters with data that can’t be easily converted into a number value,
it’s more of an unordered variable and assigning the data a value
wouldn’t make sense, thus no mean.
